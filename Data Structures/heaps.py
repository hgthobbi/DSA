# partially sorted
# max heap, root is the max of all elements. An element is greater than it's child nodes.
# min heap, root is the min of the elements. An element is smaller than it's child nodes.
# implemented as arrays
# for an element at n, it's children can be found using 2n+1 and 2n+2
# makes getting the min or max easy. Good for implementing priority qeueus.
